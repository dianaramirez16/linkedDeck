# linkedDeck
this is a java project for my data structures course using linked list, queue, and arraylist
check out the project requirements and constraints in project pdf

the game is basically WAR where all players put down a card and the highest value gets all the cards.
there are 15 rounds, and at the end the player with the most cards is declared a winner

Queue's were used, implemented by single linked lists with a single pointer to the head. 
Arraylist held the cards in the "deck"
Enums were used to give the card Suit and card Values, individual values.
Project Screenshot pdf file contains screenshot of game contents at time of submission to professor for course credit.

A shuffle function in which indices are swapped in order to properly shuffle the deck was referenced from
